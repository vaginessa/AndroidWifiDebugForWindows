# Android Wifi Debug Assistant
As an Android development, I connected my device to debug through an app name "wifiµ÷ÊÔ"(ps: you can get it through some appstore such as "Wifi调试" ect.). In order to connect my device through wifi, I have to input command `adb connect 192.168.0.100` with **Cmd** in Windows system. so this application created.

# Usage
if you want to down this application directly, get it in `bin/Debug/AndroidWifiDebug.exe`
