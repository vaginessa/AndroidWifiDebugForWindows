# Android Wifi Debug Assistant
As an Android development, I connected my device to debug through an app name "wifiµ÷ÊÔ"(ps: you can get it through some appstore such as "Íã¶¹¼Ô" ect.). In order to connect my device through wifi, I have to input command `adb connect 192.168.0.100` with **Cmd** in Windows system. so this application created.
